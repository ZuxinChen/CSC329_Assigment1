/**
 * Assignment 1 – CSC 329 Data Structures and Algorithms II
 * Due: 9/17/2024 @ 9:25am
 * Main
 * Do the following in main:
 * • Open the house input file (will be in the homework folder on Brightspace)
 * Create an instance of the priority queue you implemented.
 * • Populate the priority queue with all data from the house file (the file contains data for
 * 1000 houses).
 * • Remove items from the priority queue one at a time and display them on screen. They
 * should be displayed in value order (highest to lowest) if it is properly implemented.
 * • Write code to show that all the required methods work properly. For example. Use the
 * copy constructor to create another instance. Display data from the instance created
 * using the copy constructor. Call deepCopy and show that it worked. Call getLength and
 * show that it returns the correct value. And so on
