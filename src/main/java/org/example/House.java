/**
 * House Class
 * House Class Specifications
 * 1. Include member variables for owner(String), value(int)
 * 2. Write a default constructor.
 * 3. Write a constructor that takes values for all member variables as parameters.
 * 4. Write a copy constructor (should be a DEEP COPY of the parameter). Here is the prototype:
 * House(House other)
 * 5. Implement get/set methods for all member variables.
 * 6. Write a deepCopy method (should be a DEEP COPY of the current instance). Here is the
 * prototype:
 * House deepCopy()
 * 7. Implement an equals override. It should return a value based on the “values” and not the
 * “references”. It should return true if the owners are equal (do a value compare on the
 * owners).
